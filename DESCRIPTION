Title: 		T cell line infections with HIV-1 LAI (BRU)
Description: 	The expression levels of approximately 4600 cellular RNA 
                 transcripts were assessed in CD4+ T cell lines at different 
                 times after infection with HIV-1BRU using DNA microarrays.
                 This data corresponds to the first block of a 12 block array 
                 image (001030_08_1.GEL) in the first data set (2000095918 A) 
                 in the first experiment (CEM LAI vs HI-LAI 24hr).
                 There are two data sets, which are part of a dye-swap 
                 experiment with replicates, representing the Cy3 (green) 
                 absorption intensities for channel 1 (hiv1raw) and the
                Cy5 (red) absorption intensities for channel 2 (hiv2raw).
